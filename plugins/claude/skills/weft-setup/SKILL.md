description: Connect this agent's user to a Weft Account — a wallet for finding and paying for paid data, APIs, and real-world actions. Use when asked to set up, install, or connect Weft, when `weft_*` tools are missing, or when a task needs Weft and no credential exists. One-shot — after setup, the installed `weft` skill owns ongoing usage.

# Set up Weft

Weft gives the user one account that agents can search and spend from,
inside a spending policy. Setup means establishing that account connection
from wherever you are running. Four MCP tools arrive with it:
`weft_balance`, `weft_search`, `weft_fetch`, `weft_connection_status`.

**Auth is OAuth in the browser on first use.** There is no API key to
paste, and you must never ask the user for a password, API key, or token.

## The one decision: credential scope

| Credential | Scope | Survives |
|---|---|---|
| OAuth grant (plugin or MCP) | the user's account through one client credential store | sessions that retain that store |
| CLI credential store | one machine | that machine only |

Always establish the OAuth connection for the current client first. The grant
authorizes access to the user's account, but the client still needs its own
persisted token store. A new device or rebuilt sandbox must connect again when
that store is absent. The CLI is an optional machine-local add-on, offered last
and only where it can survive.

## Step 1 — establish the account connection (always)

Work down this list; take the first branch that applies to the surface you
are running on. Do not ask the user to choose between mechanisms — the
surface decides, and every branch ends in the same OAuth grant.

1. **Claude Code**: install the Weft plugin — it bundles the MCP server
   and this skill set.

   ```
   /plugin marketplace add weftlabs/weft-claude-plugin
   /plugin install weft@weft-labs
   /reload-plugins
   ```

   Run the reload immediately after installation, before checking tools or using
   `/weft:setup`. If Claude Code warns that reload will invalidate the prompt
   cache, run `/reload-plugins --force`; restarting Claude Code also activates
   the plugin.

   If the `weft_*` tools already respond, a connection exists — stop;
   do not add a second manual MCP connection beside it. If the user has no account, use
   `/weft:setup THEIR_EMAIL` (Step 2), never a manual connection.

   The plugin pins the production server. If the URLs in this document
   name any host other than `https://weft.network`, you are setting up a
   different deployment: skip the plugin and use branch 2 with this
   document's URLs.

2. **Host with an MCP configuration you can edit** (Codex, Cursor, Cline,
   opencode, OpenClaw, Hermes, VS Code, Copilot CLI, or any host speaking
   streamable HTTP whose config you can write): add the hosted server `https://weft.network/mcp`. Exact per-host
   config shapes are in [rules/hosts.md](rules/hosts.md) — copy the shape
   for the detected host; never guess a config format for an unknown host. If the host manages
   connections through a GUI instead of an editable config, use branch 3.

3. **GUI host with a connectors UI** (Claude desktop, claude.ai, Cowork,
   ChatGPT, other GUI clients): the human adds `https://weft.network/mcp`
   as a custom connector in the host's Connectors/Apps settings. Walk the
   human through it in plain words — typically Settings → Connectors →
   Add custom connector, then paste the URL; that is all they need. If
   the host's plan does not allow custom connectors, use branch 4.

4. **None of the above**: send the human to
   https://weft.network/dashboard/connect for manual instructions (it
   needs an account — https://weft.network/signup first if they have
   none). Stop rather than guessing.

The first tool call opens a browser sign-in; that is expected. The grant
appears under the user's Weft Connections and is revocable at any time.
A fresh session in the same client stays connected only when its credential
store persists. If that store is absent, connect the client again.

## Step 2 — no account yet?

OAuth signs in an account that already exists. If the user has none, ask
for **their email address only** — never a password — and take the ONE
path that matches how Step 1 connected. The temporary `wbt_` credential
every path creates is a secret: never print, echo, log, or paste it into
the conversation. After the human claims the account, the same credential
gains balance and fetch access — treat it like money from the start.

- **Plugin (branch 1):** run `/weft:setup THEIR_EMAIL`. The command
  creates the bootstrap and stores the credential in the plugin's private
  data without printing it. It needs Claude Code 2.1.195 or newer — on an
  older version, update Claude Code or use branch 2. Do not add a manual
  MCP connection beside the plugin, and do not use the shell flow below.
- **Editable-config host (branch 2) with a persistent filesystem:** use
  the CLI's bootstrap — it stores the
  credential in a mode-0600 local file and never prints it. Read the email
  through terminal input so user text is never inserted into shell syntax:

  ```sh
  (
    set -eu
    printf 'Email: ' >&2
    IFS= read -r WEFT_EMAIL
    npx --package @weftlabs/cli weft bootstrap --email "$WEFT_EMAIL" \
      --agent-name "MCP setup agent" --reason "Connect this client to Weft"
  )
  ```

  Then either continue on the CLI, or configure the MCP server per
  branch 2 with OAuth after the claim.
- **Host without the plugin or CLI, including branch 3 or 4:** there is no safe bootstrap
  path here, even if your own sandbox has a shell — an ephemeral
  filesystem loses the credential, and a static header can enter logs or
  project configuration. Send the human to
  https://weft.network/signup to create the account in the
  browser, then connect with OAuth per Step 1. Do not improvise an HTTP
  flow.

A claim link goes to the email. Ask the human to verify and approve through
that email. Weft applies the one-time signup grant after verification and
promotes the same credential in place — search works while pending, and balance
and fetch unlock after the claim. Then call `weft_balance`.
`weft_connection_status` reports progress.

## Step 3 — offer the CLI (only where it survives)

Offer the machine-local CLI as an **add-on** — never instead of Step 1 —
when all three hold:

- you can execute shell commands,
- Node.js is available,
- the filesystem persists across sessions — **not** an ephemeral cloud
  sandbox or container that is reclaimed after the task.

```sh
npm install -g @weftlabs/cli
```

One line to the user is enough: "Your account is connected. This machine
can also run the Weft CLI for headless and scripted use — want it?" If any
condition fails, skip this step silently; in an ephemeral environment a
CLI credential would appear to work and then vanish with the container.

## Verify

1. Follow the host's reload step (restart, or start a new session — the
   tools appear in the next session, not this one).
2. Call `weft_balance` — or `weft_connection_status` if a claim is still
   pending.
3. Confirm the `weft` usage skill is discoverable — the plugin bundles
   it; on any other surface install it from
   https://weft.network/skills/weft/SKILL.md. It owns everything from
   here: searching, spending rules, receipts. Do not duplicate its
   content.

If either check fails, report exactly what you changed and what the host
said. Do not invent an API key or fall back to an unrelated config.

## Hard rules

- Never ask for, accept, generate, or store a password, `wk_` key, or
  OAuth token. Never print a `wbt_` credential.
- One connection per host — plugin OR manual MCP entry, never both.
- `weft_balance` is the truth after the one-time signup grant. During onboarding,
  ask the human to verify the claim email; do not ask for a wallet top-up or
  promise any additional promotional balance.
