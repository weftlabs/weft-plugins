# Weft CLI reference

The `weft` CLI is the machine-local surface for the same account: same
search → choose → fetch loop, same receipts, same safety rules as the MCP
tools in [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md). Use it on a persistent machine with a
shell — for headless runs, scripts, and pipelines. Never install it in an
ephemeral cloud sandbox: its credential store dies with the container.

It prints one versioned JSON object per command — parse the output instead
of reading prose. `weft --help` and `weft <command> --help` return
machine-readable JSON and need no credential; read them before guessing a
flag.

## Install

```sh
npm install -g @weftlabs/cli
```

Zero-install equivalent for any command below:

```sh
npx --package @weftlabs/cli weft --help
```

## Commands

Once an authenticated credential exists — from the bootstrap flow below or
an existing `WEFT_API_KEY`:

```sh
weft me                                                  # who am I
weft balance                                             # wallet + spending policy
weft search "weather data API" --max-results 5           # free
weft fetch "https://merchant.example/data" --max-cost-usd 0.05
weft purchases                                           # receipt history
```

- `weft fetch` always requires `--max-cost-usd`. Set a tight ceiling; never
  omit it.
- Every spending rule from SKILL.md applies verbatim: balance before paid
  actions, state costs, no silent retries of paid calls, hard stop on policy
  refusals.

## Bootstrap (no credential yet)

The CLI can start with nothing but the human's email address. Never ask
for, accept, or store their password.

```sh
# 1. Create the temporary bootstrap; a claim link goes to the email only.
weft bootstrap --email "human@example.com" \
  --agent-name "Research agent" \
  --reason "Find weather data"

# 2. Search immediately — free, works while the claim is pending.
weft search "weather data API"

# 3. Ask the human to verify the claim email so Weft can apply the one-time
#    signup grant, then approve. Show them the user code from the bootstrap
#    response so they can match this session.

# 4. Poll at the interval the bootstrap response returned — no faster.
weft auth status

# 5. After approval the same stored bearer is durable until revoked.
weft me

# 6. Ask the human to verify the claim email so Weft can apply the one-time
#    signup grant, then check the balance.
weft balance
```

Status lifecycle: `pending` (search works, keep polling) → `claimed`
(done — the same bearer now supports normal buyer commands) or `rejected` /
`expired` / `revoked` (terminal — stop; do not create a second bootstrap for
the same request without asking the user).

The `wbt_` credential is secret. Before claim, its 30-minute search-only window
permits `search`, `status`, and `cancel`. Human approval promotes the same bearer
to durable `identity`, `search`, `balance`, `fetch`, `purchases`, `status`, and
`revoke` capabilities until the human revokes it. Refusals on balance/fetch
before the claim are the contract, not bugs. No subsidy or treasury funding is
required; paid fetch uses the human-funded wallet. The CLI stores every
credential in a mode-0600 local file and never prints secrets — neither do you.

## Credentials

Precedence: `--api-key-stdin`, then `WEFT_API_KEY`, then the stored bootstrap
or legacy OAuth credential. New bootstrap flows keep the same `wbt_` bearer
and do not register an OAuth client or call `/oauth/token`. The CLI rejects API
keys passed as command arguments so they never reach shell history. Never echo any credential —
`wbt_`, `wk_`, or an OAuth token — into your output.

## Errors

One JSON object on stderr with a stable `error.code`. Exit codes: `2`
invalid usage, `3` missing auth or 401/403, `4` other 4xx or policy
rejection, `5` 5xx/network/internal. `POLICY_VIOLATION_*` and
`SETTLEMENT_FAILED` are handled exactly as in SKILL.md.
